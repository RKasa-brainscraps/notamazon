# Where can I buy things online that isn't Amazon?

Increasingly, Amazon isn't the best place to buy things online. Spam listings, fake/knock-off items, outright fraud, and just generally a poor experience. So here are some places that you can buy stuff that has a similar experience to Amazon, without the crap.

"Similar experience" means:

* A website that's pretty easy to use (good search, easy checkout, etc)
* A pretty wide/large selection (niche/cottege businesses rock, but that's not what this list is for)
* Reasonable (or free) shipping rats (including "ship to local store for pickup")
* Generous return policies including reasonable (or free) return shipping rates
